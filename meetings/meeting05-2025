- I have taken the liberty to add kpis cards
- I have also added traffic incidentable 
- The layout is close to the picture 
- Do we want the legend to be next to the chart or under the chart ?
- Radial chart is it for more than one metric or we want single metric like the picture = (single)
- I have to add mobile responsiveness
- Most dashboards have default data that is fetched and displayed , did we say that will depend on each client ? and each client will also decide what charts to add ? Will it be the sames as phone widgets ?
