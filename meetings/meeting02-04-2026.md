- Cleaned up the dashboard UI improvements, i.e., changed the calendar from HTML to shadcn calendar
- Was working on resizing, UI, and backend (Dawid took over the backend, so I focused on the frontend)
- Submitted a PR and requested a review from Copilot. I started reviewing the comments and committed some changes.
- For now, I want to address the failing CI/CD.
- I have the dashboard-level filter UI ready, which uses the shadcn calendar. Since the filtering should not be frontend-only, I was looking at the backend_schemas. I will add the filtering properties and link them to the client.
- I also wanted to simplify the chartConfig, perhaps making it multi-chart compatible. Dawid shared a sample of how it could look. I would like to keep the present logic and simplify the UI, then add additional chart types (Bar chart, Pie chart, and Radar chart).
